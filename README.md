You-to-iss is a program that works out the distance from you to the iss (includes the height of the iss) and then displays an easy to read map of where you are in comparison to it

To run the file the requests and folium modules have to be istalled 

If they are not run the following command in terminal:
pip install requests folium

On the map the location of you should be acurate, if you are using a VPN this may make it locate you where your VPN is set to, the pin is not an exact location but the rough area that you are located at
